# Skydive

Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer.
It aims to provide a comprehensive way of understanding what is happening in
the network infrastructure.

Skydive agents collect topology informations and flows and forward them to a
central agent for further analysis. All the informations are stored in an
Elasticsearch database.

Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in order to enhance the
topology and flows informations.

## Quick start

### Docker Compose

To quick set up a working environment, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
can be used to automatically start an Elasticsearch container, a Skydive analyzer
container and a Skydive agent container.

```console
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skydive-project/skydive/master/contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:8082 to access the analyzer Web UI.

You can also use the Skydive [command line client](https://skydive-project.github.io/skydive/getting-started/client/) with:
```console
docker run -ti skydive/skydive client topology query --gremlin "g.V()"
```

### All-in-one

You can also download the latest release and use the all-in-one mode which will
start an Agent and an Analyzer at once.

```console
sudo skydive allinone [-c skydive.yml]
```
